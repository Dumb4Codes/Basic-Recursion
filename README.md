# Basic-Recursion

# Recursive Algorithms in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of three basic recursive algorithms:

1. Array Reversal
2. Fibonacci Number Generation
3. Palindrome Checker

## Getting Started

These algorithms are implemented in Java and can be run in any Java development environment. You can simply clone this repository to your local machine and compile/run the Java files.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

## Usage

### 1. Array Reversal

To reverse an array using recursion, you can use the `ArrayReversal.java` class. Modify the array you want to reverse in the code, and then run the program.

### 2. Fibonacci Number

To generate Fibonacci numbers using recursion, you can use the Fibonacci.java class. Modify the code to specify the desired Fibonacci sequence length, and then run the program.

### 3. Palindrome Checker

The PalindromeChecker.java class checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. Modify the string you want to check in the code and run the program.
